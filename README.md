## Roadmap

Please bare in mind that this project is still in development and highly experimental. Use at your own risk. Planned features:

- Integration with Loop for iOS. (Currently, Loop only supports Libre 1 and Libre 2 for closed-loop features. In the future, there are plans to integrate the data fetched to feed directly into Loop, in order to be used as a closed-loop system)

As of now, Glucow can be installed using only 2 different methods. Please have a look at https://www.glucow.com/install to find out how you can use Glucow.
