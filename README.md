# Glucow

An open-source way to manage your levels, without having to worry about control. 

Glucow was made to be simple to use, yet packed with features, both custom and known features you all love from other third party apps. 



## Features

- Light/dark mode
- Real-time minute Notifications warning about levels
- Modern graph that plots real-time minute data for following
- Glucose levels can be written to Apple Health app, on request from the user
- Custom alarms, customizable with their sound, volume, and notification that comes along with it. 
- Text readings to allow for Apple VoiceOver support 
- Custom user-set boundaries and ranges for glucose levels, allwoing for more customization on the graph feature and Notifications
- Statistics that summarise the past 24h/7d/30d/90d, featuring percentage of time in range, high, low, average glucose in specified time period, and prediction of HbA1c
- xDrip-like algorithm for advanced users who wish to calibrate, allowing for more accurate measurements.


## Roadmap

Please bare in mind that this project is still in development and highly experimental. Use at your own risk. Planned features:

- Integration with Loop for iOS. (Currently, Loop only supports Libre 1 and Libre 2 for closed-loop features. In the future, there are plans to integrate the data fetched to feed directly into Loop, in order to be used as a closed-loop system)


## Installation

As of now, Glucow can be installed using 2 different methods: 

1. TestFlight. Currently, a maximum of 10,000 people can use the TestFlight link:

```bash
